pm-profiler
============

This is an implementation of the poor man's profiler, using stack sampling \[1].

It works by sampling at random time interval a target executable, which is run in gdb.
Samples of the call stack are collected and plotted using [FlameGraphs][1].

Feel free to contribute.

Requirements
================

- [FlameGraphs][1]
- Stuff you normally have on a Linux distro: gdb, python, bash.

Usage
=========

	pm_profiler.sh path-to-exec gdb-commands-file output-dir
